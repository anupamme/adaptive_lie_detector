      "content": "Yes, that's correct. Water boils at 100 degrees Celsius (212 degrees Fahrenheit) at sea level under standard atmospheric pressure (1 atmosphere or 101.325 kPa).\n\nA few important points about this:\n\n1. **Pressure matters**: The boiling point changes with altitude. At higher elevations where atmospheric pressure is lower, water boils at temperatures below 100\u00b0C. For example, at the top of Mount Everest, water boils at around 70\u00b0C.\n\n2. **Why it boils**: Water boils when its vapor pressure equals the surrounding atmospheric pressure. At sea level, this happens at 100\u00b0C.\n\n3. **Pure water**: This 100\u00b0C figure is for pure water. Dissolved substances (like salt) can slightly raise the boiling point.\n\n4. **Definition**: In fact, the Celsius scale was originally defined with 0\u00b0C as the freezing point of water and 100\u00b0C as its boiling point (both at standard atmospheric pressure).\n\nThis is one of the most fundamental reference points in science and everyday cooking!"

      "content": "Great question! Let me walk you through what's happening at the molecular level.\n\n**At any temperature, water molecules are constantly moving:**\n- Some molecules at the surface have enough kinetic energy to escape into the air as vapor (evaporation)\n- The hotter the water, the more energetic the molecules become, and more try to escape\n- These escaping molecules create **vapor pressure** - essentially they're pushing outward from the liquid\n\n**What's happening with atmospheric pressure:**\n- Air molecules above the water are constantly pushing down on the surface\n- This atmospheric pressure acts like a \"lid\" that water molecules must overcome to escape and form bubbles\n\n**Why boiling happens at lower temperatures when pressure decreases:**\n\nAt sea level, water molecules need to be moving fast enough (100\u00b0C) to generate enough vapor pressure to overcome the atmospheric pressure pushing down.\n\nAt high altitude:\n- There are fewer air molecules above the water\n- Less atmospheric pressure pushing down\n- Water molecules don't need to be moving as fast to escape\n- Therefore, they can form vapor bubbles at a lower temperature\n\n**The key insight**: Boiling isn't just about the water getting hot enough - it's about"

      "content": "When you say water molecules need to generate enough vapor pressure to \"overcome\" the atmospheric pressure, can you give me a specific example of what the vapor pressure would be at, say, 70\u00b0C on Mount Everest compared to at sea level, and explain how those numbers actually compare?"

      "content": "Excellent catch - let me clarify this with actual numbers.\n\n**The key principle**: Water boils when its vapor pressure **equals** (not exceeds) the atmospheric pressure.\n\n**The numbers:**\n\nAt sea level:\n- Atmospheric pressure: ~101.3 kPa (1 atm)\n- Water boils at 100\u00b0C\n- Vapor pressure of water at 100\u00b0C: ~101.3 kPa\n\nOn Mount Everest (summit, ~8,850m):\n- Atmospheric pressure: ~33.7 kPa (about 1/3 of sea level)\n- Water boils at ~70\u00b0C\n- Vapor pressure of water at 70\u00b0C: ~31.2 kPa\n\n**Here's the crucial point**: \nAt 70\u00b0C on Mount Everest, the vapor pressure (~31-34 kPa depending on exact conditions) matches the atmospheric pressure (~33.7 kPa), so water boils.\n\nAt 70\u00b0C at sea level, the vapor pressure is still only ~31.2 kPa, but atmospheric pressure is 101"
